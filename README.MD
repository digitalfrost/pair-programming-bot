# Random XP Programming Wisdom #

Inspired by a post by Jb Rainsberger on [Extreme Prommming For one](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingForOne) way back in the day before *Agile* was a thing

> Train someone around you to say something from this following list at random intervals. Perhaps even find software to do this.
> - You're going to refactor that, right?
> - What's the shortest line to the end of this task?
> - YAGNI!
> - Have you got a test for that?

> There are others... you get the idea. -- **JbRainsberger**

### Requirements

Mac OS (comes with say) or Linux with Festival

Currently uses Leo as the voice - because programming wisdom sounds better with a german accent!
